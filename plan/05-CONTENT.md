## Tone Guidelines

### Do
- Be confident but not arrogant
- Use action verbs (automate, build, scale, deliver)
- Speak to business outcomes, not just features
- Be specific with numbers when possible
- Address pain points directly

### Don't
- Use excessive jargon
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Sound corporate or stuffy
- Overuse buzzwords (synergy, leverage, etc.)
- Be vague about what we actually do

### Voice Examples

**Too formal:**
"Korvol Technologies offers comprehensive web automation solutions 
designed to optimize operational efficiency."

**Too casual:**
"We're the web scraping wizards who'll totally crush your data needs!"

**Just right:**
"We build custom automation that saves you time and gets you the 
data you need. No templates, no shortcuts—just solutions that work."
